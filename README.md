# Two Bit Circus Foundation STEAM Carnival Platform

Two Bit Circus Foundation STEAM Carnival Platform is a project of Two Bit Circus Foundation (2BCF), a 501(c)(3) STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) education nonprofit based in Los Angeles, but with a global reach. 2BCF primarily works with youth from underserved communities. More information about Two Bit Circus Foundation can be found [here](https://twobitcircus.org).

The STEAM Carnival Platform provides a fun, engaging, remote "carnival" experience for groups of students ranging from kindergarten to high school to help them celebrate and enjoy STEAM. The Platform's main features include puzzles, quizzes, a livestreaming MC, and a live leaderboard.

### Project context

The online STEAM Carnival was developed during the pandemic in an attempt to substitute for an [in-person enrichment experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4i80EEkro). At the current time, it is requested by schools with hybrid attendance plans, and post-pandemic, can continue to be used as an engagment activity.
