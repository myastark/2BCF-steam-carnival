# Two Bit Circus Foundation STEAM Carnival Platform

Two Bit Circus Foundation STEAM Carnival Platform is a project of Two Bit Circus Foundation, a 501(c)(3) STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) education nonprofit based in Los Angeles but with a global reach. More information about Two Bit Circus Foundation can be found [here](https://twobitcircus.org).

The STEAM Carnival Platform provides a fun, engaging, remote "carnival" experience for groups of students ranging from kindergarten to high school to help them celebrate and enjoy STEAM. The Platform's main features include puzzles, quizzes, a livestreaming MC, and a live leaderboard.

### Project context

The online STEAM Carnival was developed during the pandemic in an attempt to substitute for an [in-person enrichment experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kn4i80EEkro). At the current time, it is requested by schools with hybrid attendance plans, and post-pandemic, can continue to be used as an engagment activity.

# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/share/zt-s0wgkmx0-jVCbyIKm5KUpTlkscywyFw).
- Choose an [issue](https://github.com/myastark/2BCF-steam-carnival/issues) to work on.





## Installation instructions [I don't know how to do this]

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues
